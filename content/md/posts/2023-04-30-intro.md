## Introduction

Hello everyone. My name is Eitan and this is a blog about my experience with making a cljs application. The following posts will document my steps in setting up the application, and making the various features. I hope you gain something out of viewing my journey of making an application. 

The rest of this post will talk about how I set up my blog.

### Making a Blog

I used a tool called [Cryogen](https://cryogenweb.org/docs/getting-started.html), following the steps in the site README. 
I also added a github action to automate the process of updating the site anytime a pull request on the main branch got merged. I followed these [steps](https://practical.li/blog-staging/posts/automate-cryogen-clojure-blog-with-github-actions/) to add a github action that `on push` clones the repository and runs `lein build` to generate a build for the site and after copies the files to the `live` branch, triggering the automated _githhub pages_ deployment.
