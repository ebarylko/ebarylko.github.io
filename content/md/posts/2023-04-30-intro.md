This intro only documents a subset of Cryogen's features. For additional documentation please see the [cryogen site](http://cryogenweb.org).

## Introduction

Hello everyone. My name is Eitan and this is a blog about my experience with making a cljs application. The following posts will document my steps in setting up the application, and making the various features. I hope you gain something out of viewing my journey of making an application. 

The rest of this post will talk about how I set up my blog.

### Making a Blog

I used a tool called Cryogen, following the steps in the site below.
https://cryogenweb.org/docs/getting-started.html
I also added a github action to automate the process of updating the site anytime a pull request on the main branch went through. I followed the steps in the site below to do this.
